# COMMENT CLEANUP PYTHON SCRIPT - v0.1
#
# Simple build system helper script that removes the initial comment block from
# the make configuration files used to build the final make script.
#
# THIS IS SIMPLY A TEMPORARY FIX, A STUPID ONE AT THAT
# Ultimately, of course we should use awk or sed, but I don't know either, and
# don't feel like learning right now, or loose any more sleep with this darn
# build system (I just wanna code :-( )
